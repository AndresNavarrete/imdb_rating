# Movies rating predictor

Did you ever wonder if it's possible to predict if a movie will be good or bad based on the cast, the crew members or the budget? This public repository provides some machine learning models oriented to answering this question. 

### Purpose of this project
This public project is learning exercise with machine learning models. The goal is to predict, as accurate as possible, the [IMDB] rating of a movie just considering public data avaiable.

In the `regression_models.ipynb` file you will find a step by step juypter notebook with the data cleaning process, the model calibration and the results of my work using regression models.

All models have been calibrated using the [TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset] provided by [Kaggle].
